		$ ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
			username: bandit10
			password: truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk


2.	As the admin says - 
		" The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains 
		  base64 encoded data"


3.	Base64 encoding treats binary data as integers and translates it into a base64 representation.
	Base64 uses [A-Z] [a-z] and [0-9] for the first 62 values. Each Base64 digit represents 
	exactly 6-bits of data. 
	By using the information about Base64 encoding, I thought of making a python script for 
	decoding Base64 encoding. (just for fun)


4.	Alternatively we can use the 'base64' command for linux systems. Where -d flag is for 'decode'
		
		$ base64 -d data.txt					
		The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR


~>	So, above is the password for Bandit's level11.
