1.	First loging in to remote server via ssh
		
		$ ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
			username: bandit9
			password: UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR


2.	As the admin says-
		" The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few
		  human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters. "	
 		

			$ ls								// We see large file with random data stored
			data.txt
			
			$ strings data.txt					// We see only the strings in entire file
			...
	
	
	You can find the password here also. To get more accurate result -

			$ strings data.txt | sort | grep -o "[[:punct:]]* \w*" 
			...
			truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
			...


~>	Here, we get the above string as output in one of the lines. We used the 'strings' 
	program which outputs all the strings contained in a file. We also used '-o' option
	with grep which shows 'only' matched results.

		The above string is used as a password for level10
