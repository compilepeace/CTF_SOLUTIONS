1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit19
		  password: IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x 

	
2.	As the admin says -
		"To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory.
		Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be
		found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary. "


3.	If a program has setuid bit set on it (suppose setuid root), then the program whenever invoked by
	a normal user will always run as a part of setuid user (in assumed case - root).
	The program in this challenge also has a setuid bit set, which can be viewed by long listing the
	home directory contents which shows -

	-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 7408 Dec 28 14:34 bandit20-do

	This 's' here in place of executable indicates the setuid bit. The program here runs on behalf of
	the bandit20 user, who has access to the file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20


		$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
		GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
		
	
~>	We got the passcode to the next level(20) - "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j"
