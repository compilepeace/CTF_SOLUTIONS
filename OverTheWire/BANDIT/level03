~> Here, the admin stored the password in a hidden file ( files prefixed with a period '.' 
   symbol are treated as hidden files on linux system, generally hidden files are made and
   used as configuration files by the system ).
   So we used the cat command to view the hidden file.

   The above string is used as password for the next level (i.e. level4).
