1.	First login to the remote server - bandit.labs.overthewire.org listening on port 2220
		
		$ ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		username: bandit7
		password: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

2.	As the admin says -
		 " Password for level8 is stored in file data.txt next to the word 'millionth'. "

3.	Here, we'll need to use the 'grep' command along with regular expressions (no needed 
	indeed but good to search about) to find the desired flag/key to next level.

4.	When we cat the file - data.txt we see that a large file containing different names
	along with a passwords is made.

		
		$ grep "millionth" data.txt
		millionth	cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV


~>	Here, we successfully extracted the key for the next level by using simple 'grep' 
	command. see manual page for grep. 
	The above key is used as a password for level8.
