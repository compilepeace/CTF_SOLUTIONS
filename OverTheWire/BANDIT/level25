1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit25
		  password: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG 

	
2.	As the admin says -
		 "Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not 
		 /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it."
