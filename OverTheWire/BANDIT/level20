1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit20
		  password: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j

	
2.	As the admin says -
		"There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection
		to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text 
		from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the 
		password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21)."

	

3.	Now to get the password to the next level,we need to set up a listening service on any non used 
	port say - 50000. To set up TCP or UDP connections we use netcat tool ('nc' command). The binary
	suconnect takes in port number as an argument parameter and asks for password of the current
	level once the connection is made, if the password is correct, it sends the password to the 
	listening port. So for this I logged on twice to the bandit20 level. (once to set up the listening
	service and second to run the "suconnect" binary)

		$ echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p 50000
		
	It waits silently for the incoming connections.
	
		$ ./suconnect 56789
		Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
		Password matches, sending next password

	The listening port then prints the password for us -

		$echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p 56789   
		gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr



~>	Hence we obtain the password string for the next level(21) - "gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr"
