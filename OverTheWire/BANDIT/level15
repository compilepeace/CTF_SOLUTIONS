1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit15
		  password: BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr


2.  As the admin says -
		" The passsword for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current 
		level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.
			
		Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the 
		“CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command 
		also works in this version of that command… "


3.	We read the "OpenSSL Cookbook - Testing with OpenSSL" (provided as Helpful Reading Material by admin)
	after getting the basics about SSL/TLS (Secured Socket layer / Transport Layer Security).
	
		$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign_eof
		...
		A whole bunch of information by server
		...
		BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr
		Correct!
		cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd


4.	With the help of the above command -
	We connect to a localhost service running on port number: 30001 via openssl (which makes us connect 
	to the server speaking SSL/TLS. 
	The 's_client' is a standard command which implements a SSL/TLS client establishing a connection
	with the server speaking SSL/TLS ( Referenced from the manual ).


~>	Thus we get the password string for next level(16) - "cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd"
