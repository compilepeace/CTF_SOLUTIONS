1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit14
		  password: 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e


		2.  As the admin says -
					" The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of 
			the current level to port 30000 on localhost. "


2.	We can do this by connecting to the service running at port 30000 on localhost by telnet.
	
		$ telnet localhost 30000
		Trying ::1...
		Trying 127.0.0.1...
		Connected to localhost.
		Escape character is '^]'.
		4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
		Correct!
		BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr

		Connection closed by foreign host.

	
	So, this service offers the password after we give it the password of this level as input
	The password for the next level(15) is "BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr"
