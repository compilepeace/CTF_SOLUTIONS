1.	First loging into remote server via ssh
		$ ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
			username: bandit11
			password: IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR


2.	As the admin says -
		"The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z)
		 and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions. " 


3.	There are different ways of rotating the string by 13 letter positions - 
		
		(a) I started out by making a python script for this purpose. (named - rotate13.py)
		(b) Secondly there is a command line tool called 'tr' which is used to either transliterate
			charecters (i.e. converting one alphabet to another).
			
			$ echo "Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh" | tr [a-zA-Z] [n-za-mN-ZA-M]
		

~>	The password for the level12 is '5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu'.
