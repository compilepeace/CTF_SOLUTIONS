1.	First, we login to the remote sever with ssh

		$ ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		username: bandit5
		password: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

		$ ls
		$ cd inhere
		$ ls
		
2.	Here we see many directories named 'maybehere{00-17}' and level5 states that the 
	password has following charecterstics - 
			
			* human-readable
			* 1033-bytes in size
			* not-executable

3.	For this we need to research the topics - Regular Expressions and find.		

4.  Since we are told that it is 1033-bytes long, we search for a file with exact size
	of 1033-bytes. This can be done with the help of 'find' command which is used to 
	search for files in a directory (or subdirectories even) with variety of attributes.

													
													
		$ find . -type f -size 1033c				# Syntax - find directory0 -options
		./inhere/maybehere07/.file2					
		
		$ cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2

~>	Here we used 'find' command which acts as a utility to find desired files based on
	variety of attributes. Here -size option uses '1033c', 'c' here stands for a 
	charecter byte. It matches any file with 1033-bytes size.
	The above string is used as a password for next level.
