1.	First we login to remote server via ssh
	
		$ ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
		
			username: bandit6
			password: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7


2.	The admin tells about the charecterstics of the password -
		
		* owned by the user bandit7
		* owned by the group bandit6
		* 33 bytes in size

3.	So, based on the above information, we use find command to find the flag. We will start
	our searching from root directory in this case since the file is on our server anywhere.


		$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 
		...

	
	We got many result cases telling "find: find: '/run/user/11023': Permission denied"				
	In between all there errors in our location found. 
	So, what do we do here is redirect stderr (fd 2) to some place known as a 'black hole'
	in linux systems - /dev/null. The data sent to this location goes nowhere.
	

			$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
			/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
		
			$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
			HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
		

~>	Here we learnt more about 'find' command and also discarding errors by redirecting stderr
	(fd 2) stream. 
	The above string in used as password to level7.
