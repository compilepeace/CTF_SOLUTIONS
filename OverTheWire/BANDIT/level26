1.  First loging in to the remote server via ssh

        $ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220	

	
2.	As the admin says -
		 "Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not 
		 /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it."


~>	This one is a very creative one, this level took advantage of the behaviour of 'more' command being a
	pager program (i.e. displays information page-by-page)
	you simply need to access the file before you log out of the system which indeed is happening as you
	log in to this level. 
	To make this happen - resize your terminal window to the minimum. Then log in and you will see that
	the banner of bandit26 is being half displayed.
	
	You can use vim in more by pressing 'v'.
	Once entered vim mode type - 
	:r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
	After some instructions pop up press Enter

~>	This password string is retrieved - "5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z"
	which is password to level-27 (not made till now)
