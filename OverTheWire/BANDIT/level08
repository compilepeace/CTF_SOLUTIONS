1.	First, loging in to the remote server running ssh-server on port 2220
		
		$ ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
			username: bandit8
			password: cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV


2.	As the admin says - 
		" Password is stored in a file data.txt on the line of text that occurs only once "
	
		$ ls 
		data.txt		
		$ cat data.txt				# We see a large file filled with keys
		...

 
3. 	Next, we should come up with a command which segregates a unique line within bunch of
	lines in a file. For that we use 'uniq' command with -u flag.


		$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

~>	The 'uniq' command removes the duplicate lines from the sorted output which is piped 
	into it as input (pipe operator). But when 'uniq' command is used in conjunction with
	-u flag, it displays only the unique line from the sorted input given to it.

		The above string is used as password for level9.
